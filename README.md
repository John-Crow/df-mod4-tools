Using the NIST NSRL makes your investigations faster because you can ignore known files.

## Exercise 2
Viewing file types by extension and tagging them, then generating a report in Excel to copy the hash values of the evidence files in to Autopsy to create a new hash database of notable files.

Hex Editors are useful because they allow us to analyze raw data at the binary level to find remnants of files that can tie the criminal to a victim. 

## Exercise 4
Create an ex4 folder in my repository and create an evidence.txt file in it. Copy the Message to CyberChef to encrypt and save as a txt file named nothing.txt. Then decrypt the txt file using my keyword and save to another txt file named recovered.txt.
